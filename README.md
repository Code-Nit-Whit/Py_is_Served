Py_is_Served
 Python's http.server module wrapped in a graphical interface with hot reloading, configurability, and ease of use. Upcomng release of v0.1.0 to include prebuilt executable binaries for the major desktop platforms and possibly an installer for quick, hands free setup. 

 This projecct is still in early development. As of now, the server is functional. Testing and fine tuning is ongoing for hot reloading functionality, and may be usable by the time anyone gets around to reading this.
